@* main template of Layout *@
@* to dont write the same code in each View file we -> we put this code here, 
it is apply to all View files *@

@* this file is common for all Views , because it is in Views folder, if you want 
create new -> Layout file for only specific views -you can make _ViewStart.cshtml 
file in the folder of those Views  (for example in folder Book we create file-> 
_ViewStart.cshtml with other layout -> @{Layout = "different layout"} and this 
Layout will be applied only for Views inside Book folder)*@

@* The scope of _ViewStart applied to current folder (in which
_ViewStart file is placed) and to all the sub folders*@

@* This file runs before View will be rendered in the browser, the code in this file will be applied to all Views *@
@* if Layout is different for any of the View.cshtml files 
-you can write it down in that file (on the top)-> @{Layout = "Different Layout"} 

or uses non of the Layout templates -->   @{Layout = null;} 
*@


@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
